the ability to sell, buy, save and retrieve their stocks with a mock balance, register mock creditcards, keep track of their transactions and bought stocks, as well as observe the latest updates in the stock market. It is designed with clean architecture in mind,
making use of dependancy injection to build a scalable, maintainble and easy to use application with simple and clean UI for the users to enjoy. It also includes an authentication, login and reset features making it possible for users to create multiple accounts and track
